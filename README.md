# Enhanced k-means

1. Project Goal: Improve the accuracy of K-means clustering because standard functions sometimes create clusters that are  not too close  each other.

2. Data Source: Use data from a shopping mall. (2023 data download from kanggal).

3. Data Cleaning: Clean the data to make it ready for analysis.

4. Handle Missing Data: Deal with any missing values in the data.

5. Determine Clusters: Use the elbow method to decide how many clusters are needed.

6. Apply Enhanced K-means: Implement the improved version of K-means clustering.

7. Visualize Results: Create a 2D visual representation of the clusters.

8. Comparison: Compare the standard K-means results with the enhanced K-means results to see the improvement.
